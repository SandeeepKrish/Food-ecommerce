# Project Overview
This project is an e-commerce website developed using React, Redux, React-Bootstrap, and Material UI, where users can browse and select food items from different restaurants, add them to a cart, view detailed information, and manage their orders. The website provides an intuitive interface similar to food ordering platforms like Zomato, focusing on seamless user experience and dynamic state management using Redux.

# Features
Interactive Dashboard: Users can explore a wide variety of food items, filter their selection, and easily add them to the cart.

Cart Management: Redux is used for efficient state management, allowing users to view the details of the selected food items (including the restaurant name, price, and rating) directly from their cart.

Food Details: In the cart, users can see comprehensive details about the food, such as the restaurant from which the food comes, its price, and the rating.

Add/Remove Items from Cart: Users can add their preferred food items to the cart and also remove them at any time.

Responsive Design: Built using React-Bootstrap and Material UI for a responsive and visually appealing interface.
